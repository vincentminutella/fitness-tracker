## Next.js App 

This is an in-progress project for a fitness dashboard  application with authentication and user management.

This repository is linked to an active deployment via Vercel with a PostgreSQL backend.

There is only one user configured, you can try it out if you want to see the UI:

https://fitness-tracker-sepia.vercel.app

user - vincent.minutella888@gmail.com 

pass - 123456

Please make sure you set the credentials back when you're finished (The email field is read-only to prevent mischief) 

I promise, the update functionality works but this is hosted on Vercel through AWS in a free environment. 
The latency is outrageously high and you might have to wait for the environment to 'warm up' for a couple clicks 
before it is consistent.
