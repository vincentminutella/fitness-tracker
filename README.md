## Next.js App 

This is a rough draft of a generic dashboard style application with authentication and user management. I am still deciding
on sample data for the metrics page. 

This repository is linked to an active deployment via Vercel with a postgres backend.

There is only one user configured, you can try it out if you want to see the UI:

https://fitness-tracker-sepia.vercel.app

user - vincent.minutella888@gmail.com 

pass - 123456

Please make sure you set the credentials back when you're finished. 

I promise, the update functionality works but this is hosted on Vercel through AWS 
in a free environment. The latency is outrageously high and you might have to 
wait for the environment to 'warm up' for a couple clicks before it is consistent.
